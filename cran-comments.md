## Resubmission
This is a third submission. In this version I have

* Made ensure that I do not comment out some code lines in examples.
* Changed all the information messages using `cat()` to `message()`.

## Resubmission
This is a second submission. In this version I have

* Used `\donttest{}` (instead of `\dontrun{}`) for some tests listed under examples because the algorithm is (by design) computationally expensive. 
* Made ensure that I do not use more than 2 cores in the examples, vignettes, etc.

* macOS-latest (on GitHub Actions), (release)
